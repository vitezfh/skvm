skvm.sh
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

skvm.sh is a shell script that acts as a software kvm switch

Note:
    It is a fork from the awesome github.com/kokoko3k/ssh-rdp
    All the hard work was done on that repo by the awesome kokoko3k, this is 
    merely stealing the input forwarding part of his project

Since the input control happens at low level by using netevent,
every input device can actually be forwarded to the remote host.
This means keyboards,mouses,joypads,racing wheels and so on, thus
allowing you to actually remotely play.

apart from the ssh server, skvm.sh does not require a specific server 
running on the remote side, but a set of tools needs to be present 
remotely and others locally:

Software requirements:
    * Local and Remote: bash, openssh, netevent
    * Local: taskset

Special requirements for input forwarding:
    * Local user need to access files under /dev/input,
      so make sure it is in the input group.
    * Remote user need access to special device /dev/uinput
      You can do that by install the provided 70-uinput.rules 
      into /etc/udev/rules.d on the remote side and reboot it.

Usage:
    To make it work, first start it with the "inputconfig" option 
    and pay attention to what it asks you.
    Next, start it with -h parameter alone to see all the options.

    There are other tunables you can find in the script.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use skvm.sh inputconfig to create or change the input config file

-s, --server        Remote host to connect to
-u, --user          ssh username
-p, --port          ssh port
    --rexec-before  Execute the specified script via 'sh' just before the connection
    --rexec-exit    Execute the specified script via 'sh' before exiting the script


Examples:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter connecting to jserver, all defaults accepted
    skvm.sh --user venkman --server jserver

I'm open to suggestions to make this software better!
